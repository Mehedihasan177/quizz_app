This is an example Android project that demonstrates the integration of Hilt for dependency injection, following the Clean architecture pattern, and using the CachedNetworkImage for image loading. A count timer is also used in this project. Shared preference is used to store data locally. And the Navigation component.

[Note: When using HTML package to convert html to text then shows an error.
But If didn't face any problem then I could implement that.
error is:
/C:/Users/Mehedi%20Hasan/AppData/Local/Pub/Cache/hosted/pub.dev/flutter_layout_grid-1.0.6/lib/src/widgets/placement.dart:82:55: Error: A value of type 'RenderObject?' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'AbstractNode?'.
 - 'RenderObject' is from 'package:flutter/src/rendering/object.dart' ('/C:/src/flutter/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/object.dart').
